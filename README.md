Hello! Welcome to our project! This was created for the CUNY Tech Prep Data Science Track Final Project

# Getting Started
Firstly, ensure that python is installed on your device. Refer to <a href=https://www.python.org/downloads/>the Python Documentation</a> for more information on how to install.

To install all of the dependencies, you'll need to first make a virtual environment like so :
```bash
py -m venv .venv
```
Next, you'll want to activate the venv like so:
```bash
.venv/Scripts/activate
```
Or on Mac:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Now navigate to the `backend` directory.
Then, you'll want to install all backend dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run any notebook files you can run the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
It will open a new tab on your default browser, now you can navigate to any ipynb's.
